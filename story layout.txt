You are the captain of a magical flying ship,(name)
your job is to guide your legion's troops across battles
The bear legion, tough and strong, is your legion

level 1, your legion's scavenge team has sent a man to gather any resources left behind after the last fight.
He needs guidance through his first obstacle, the jungle before making his long journey the rest of the way

level 2, the scavenger before has in need of your help again, taking a short cut, he and the two survivor he found
needs to break through the enemies' ruined walls left from a old base

level 3, You have been assigned a dedicated squad, the deer legion has sent their general over to 
check up on the situation. He will be tagging along on this next mission in destroying the enemy scouting camp. 

level 4, The general has left your squad with some of his troops to assist you in your next push against the enemy.
this time against one of their main camps in the jungle.

level 5, the jungle is nearly clear from all enemies, time to clean up the remaining enemy, a small camp but they
have archers there, becareful.

level 6, pressing on, the deserts is the next area to attack, you and your squad have to push through a heavily
fortified gate leading the charge. Lucky for the legion, the sparrow general is there to help you.

level 7, now that the gate is destroyed, sparrow legion and deer legion located in the desert
has no problem assisting your legion further. sparrow legion has as well left your legion with some troops. Now
it is time again to destroy another enemy camp, enemy walls have spikes on them now it seems to keep our men away,
good thing our soldiers are not that dumb to walk into them blindly right?

level 8, the sparrow legion base camp is under attack, they have helped us so we must definitely return the favour.

level 9, revenge is at hand, its time to strike back at the enemy once more for even thinking of attacking us. Revenge
is the number one thing for the crab legion, their general is in town.

level 10, turns out the revenge missions turn into a slaughter fest, clearing all thats in the desert. The mountains
is the next stop and like before, they have a well protected gate to be destroyed.

level 11, the mountains is no normal place, its filled with magical aura and secret passage ways, we are not going
to be able to move on given the enemy has managed to block off the main route with the magic artifact they found,
time to take a shortcut. Scouts have reported the "shortcut" to be filled with arrow towers.

level 12, the time for waiting is over, its time to step in the fight, said the lizard legion. let their powers
reign choas to the enemy. lizard general will be finally making her appearance for the first time in battle. She
will be assisting you in destroying the enemy artifact.

level 13, The main route is cleared and the rest of the different legions are able to reinforce the front lines,
easier and faster now, but the leading charge is still all yours. Proceed on in destroying the enemy camps, with
the new troops from the lizard legion backing us it should be no problem

level 14, This next camp is huge, lack of walls though but many troops, it might be tough to hold out but at 
least they have equal trouble as well.

level 15, the final push for getting rid of the enemy in this region is finally here. this will be the hardest of them
all but itll be worth it.
